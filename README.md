# Divvy (Android)
Divvy is a custom built app using [MUSAP Android Library](https://github.com/methics/musap-android). Divvy can be used to integrate a server-side application to YubiKey and other SSCDs. 

Divvy is currently used in a two way collaboration between [Client-DIDS](https://github.com/NGI-TRUSTCHAIN/CLIENT-DIDS) and [MUSAP Project](https://github.com/NGI-TRUSTCHAIN/MUSAP_project/).
